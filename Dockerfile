# The reason we do this is because we're submitting the join form on the client side, and
# NextJS won't let us update this arg at runtime like that. Part of the "accept everyhing"
# work could (should) be to make the client talk to the meshforms server, then we can
# control this (and talk to meshdb via the cluster!)
